Corstone SSE-315 with Ethos-U65 Example Subsystem for Ecosystem FVP
===================================================================

Introduction
------------

Corstone-315 is an Arm reference subsystem for secure System on Chips containing
an Armv8.1-M Cortex-M85 processor and LCM, KMU and SAM IPs. and an
Ethos-U65 neural network processor. It is an MPS4 based platform.

This platform port supports all TF-M regression tests (Secure and Non-secure)
with Isolation Level 1 and 2.

.. note::

   For Ethos-U65 IP this platform support only provides base address,
   interrupt number and an example NPU setup as non-secure, unprivileged.

.. note::

   For Armclang compiler v6.18 or later version is required.

Building TF-M
-------------

Follow the instructions in :doc:`Building instructions </building/tfm_build_instruction>`.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Build instructions with platform name: arm/mps4/corstone315
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``-DTFM_PLATFORM=arm/mps4/corstone315``

.. note::

   The built binaries can be run on the Corstone-315 Ethos-U65 Ecosystem FVP
   (FVP_Corstone_SSE-315).

.. note::

   If ``-DTFM_DUMMY_PROVISIONING=ON`` then the keys in the
   ``tf-M/platform/ext/target/arm/mps4/corstone315/provisioning/bundle_cm/cm_provisioning_config.cmake``,
   ``tf-M/platform/ext/target/arm/mps4/corstone315/provisioning/bundle_dm/dm_provisioning_config.cmake`` and
   default MCUBoot signing and encryption keys will be used for provisioning.

   If ``-DTFM_DUMMY_PROVISIONING=OFF`` is set then unique values can be used for provisioning. The keys
   and seeds can be changed by passing the new values to the build command, or by setting the
   ``-DDM_PROVISIONING_KEYS_CONFIG`` and  ``-DCM_PROVISIONING_KEYS_CONFIG` flag to the .cmake files
   which contain the keys. An example config cmake file can be seen at
   ``tf-m/platform/ext/target/arm/mps4/corstone315/provisioning/bundle_cm/cm_provisioning_config.cmake``
   and ``tf-m/platform/ext/target/arm/mps4/corstone315/provisioning/bundle_dm/dm_provisioning_config.cmake``.
   Otherwise new random values are going to be generated and used (or default values in some cases). For the image signing
   the ${MCUBOOT_KEY_S} and ${MCUBOOT_KEY_NS} will be used. These variables should point to
   .pem files that contain the code signing private keys. The public keys are going to be generated
   from these private keys and will be used for provisioning. The hash of the public key is going to
   be written into the ``provisioning_data.c`` automatically. For the BL2 image encryption the
   ``TFM_BL2_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PATH`` has to be set to a .bin file which contains the encryption key.
   (For an example, see ``tf-m/bl1/bl1_2/bl2_dummy_encryption_key.bin``)

   If ``-DMCUBOOT_GENERATE_SIGNING_KEYPAIR=ON`` is set then a new MCUBoot signing public and private
   keypair is going to be generated and it's going to be used to sign the S and NS binaries.


   The new generated keypair can be found in the ``<build dir>/bin`` folder or in the
   ``<install directory>/image_signing/keys`` after installation.
   The generated provisioning_data.c file can be found at
   ``<build directory>/platform/target/provisioning/provisioning_data.c``

.. note::

   The provisioning bundle generation depends on pyelftools that's have to be installed::

    pip3 install pyelftools


To run the example code on Corstone-315 Ethos-U65 Ecosystem FVP
---------------------------------------------------------------
FVP is available to download `here <https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/arm-platforms-software/arm-ecosystem-fvps>`__

#. Install the FVP
#. Copy ``bl1_1.bin``, ``cm_provisioning_bundle.bin``, ``dm_provisioning_bundle.bin``,
   ``bl2_signed.bin`` and ``tfm_s_ns_signed.bin``  files from
   build dir to ``<FVP installation path>/models/Linux64_GCC-6.4/``
#. Navigate to the same directory and execute the following command to start FVP::

    $ ./FVP_Corstone_SSE-315 --data "bl1_1.bin"@0x11000000
                   --data "cm_provisioning_bundle.bin"@0x12024000
                   --data "dm_provisioning_bundle.bin"@0x1202aa00
                   --data "bl2_signed.bin"@0x12031400
                   --data "tfm_s_ns_signed.bin"@0x38000000


#. After completing the procedure you should be able to see similar messages
   to this on the serial port (baud 115200 8n1)::
