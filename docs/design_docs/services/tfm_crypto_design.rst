Abstract
--------

This document describes the design of the TF-M Cryptographic Secure Service
(in short, TF-M Crypto service).

Introduction
------------

The TF-M Crypto service provides an implementation of the PSA Certified Crypto
APIs in a PSA RoT secure partition in TF-M. It is based on the Mbed TLS
project, which provides a reference implementation of the PSA Crypto APIs as a
`C` software library. For more details on the PSA Crypto APIs refer to [1]_,
while for the Mbed TLS reference software refer to [2]_ and [3]_

The service can be requested by other services running in the SPE, or by
applications running in the NSPE, and its aim is to provide cryptographic
primitives in a secure and efficient way, either via software or by routing the
calls to any underlying crypto hardware accelerator or secure element that the
platform might provide.

Components
----------

The TF-M Crypto service is implemented by a number of different firmware
components residing in the Crypto partition, which are listed below:

Relationship between Mbed TLS and the TF-M Crypto service
---------------------------------------------------------

TF-M Crypto as a particular configuration of Mbed TLS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Up until `TF-Mv2.0`, the TF-M Crypto service used to provide its own separate
implementation of the PSA Certified Crypto APIs, i.e. it provided its own
version of the implementation defined aspects of the specifications. Starting
from `TF-Mv2.1`, the TF-M Crypto service fully aligns to the implementation
defined by the Mbed TLS project, i.e. its implementation defined aspects are
the same as the ones defined by Mbed TLS.

As a consequence, starting from `TF-Mv2.1` the PSA Crypto headers available
in TF-M are a copy of those distributed by the Mbed TLS project. TF-M just
uses them and won't accept any contribution to them, as those need to be
discussed in the scope of the Mbed TLS project.

TF-M then represents just a configuration of the Mbed TLS reference
implementation where the TF-M Crypto APIs are provided as a remote call across
a transport channel, which might be represented by a TrustZone boundary (in
Armv8.x-M systems), by a mailbox channel in heterogeneous systems, e.g. Cortex-A
+ Cortex-M systems, by an SPM mediated interface, e.g. partition to partition
calls or, in general, through a mechanism which provides process separation
between the client and the service sides of the API.
In this context, the client must always define the Mbed TLS config option
``MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_CLIENT``, while the service must always have
``MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_SPM``, mainly to avoid symbol clashing at link time between
the library interface and the ``tfm_crypto_api.c`` interface. When there is a
component on the service side which is able to identify the client through an
ID, it is recommended to also define ``MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_KEY_ID_ENCODES_OWNER``
option in order to provide separation in the key space.

Usage of Mbed TLS configuration headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mbed TLS uses two different configuration headers, specified through the setting
of the ``MBEDTLS_CONFIG_FILE``, i.e. Mbed TLS config, and the setting of
``MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_CONFIG_FILE``, i.e. the PSA configuration. In order to be
able to perform header inclusion for ``psa/crypto.h``, the configuration files
must be visible to the compilation unit through the include hierarchy. If none of
the macros are defined, the fall back strategy is to include the default config
files available in the Mbed TLS repo, i.e. ``include/mbedtls/mbedtls_config.h``
and ``include/psa/crypto_config.h``, which contain a set of default values for
the macros.

Usage of the default header config when using the TF-M Crypto service is highly
discouraged, mainly because both on the client side and on the service side a
set of options must always be defined (or undefined), as described in the
previous section. TF-M provides example _profiles_ which show the options and
how they should be used on both client and service side of the integration. Note
that to avoid falling back to the default PSA configuration, the Mbed TLS config
file must always define the symbol ``MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_CONFIG``. The symbol to
enable the Mbed TLS config ``MBEDTLS_CONFIG_FILE`` instead must be available to
the unit being compiled which is including ``psa/crypto.h``, i.e. passed by the
build system config stage.

Hardware acceleration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The TF-M Crypto partition must handle all HW related crypto tasks, if the
platform is capable of offering hardware acceleration or if a complete Secure
Element is present. The main difference between the two is that a hardware
accelerator does not store keys but just accelerates operations, while a Secure
Element is capable of storing keys and the PSA Crypto core running on the host
must interface with it to store, retrieve or use them for crypto tasks, etc.

There are currently two methods to interface an accelerator into the Crypto
service, and both rely on the Crypto partition fully owning the Crypto hardware,
i.e. the memory mapped IO space must be bound the Crypto partition only. Both
methods are implemented through the capability of the _backend_ library to
either:

1. Provide a link time mechanism to replace pure SW implementations for algorithms
   with HW assisted implementations. In this case, the TF-M platform provides some
   additional HW abstraction through the usage of ``crypto_hw_accelerator_*()``
   APIs. This is dubbed the `_ALT` approach and will be soon to be deprecated
   potentially starting from the release of Mbed TLS 4.0
2. Provide a cleanly defined interface specification [4]_ to describe the APIs that
   a driver must expose to the PSA Crypto core in order for the core to be able to
   offload operations to hardware. This is the preferred method for interfacing with
   HW.

Both solutions are currently handled at build time (either compilation or linking)
by Mbed TLS. For details on how to integrate a driver please refer directly to the
documentation referenced above and to the Mbed TLS repo.

Builtin keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A particular driver using the interface described in [4]_ is the TF-M Builtin
Key Loader driver [5]_. The goal of the driver is to make Mbed TLS aware of
*transparent builtin keys*, i.e. keys which can be read from the core (i.e. not
fully opaque keys), but that are normally bound to the platform and provisioned
in it, for which it would be more appropriate to treat them as standard
*transparent keys*. The concept of *transparent builtin keys* is not defined
in the spec so it is specifically a non standard extension added by TF-M to the
Mbed TLS implementation, which might be changed between releases until a standard
solution is adopted. TF-M patches Mbed TLS on the fly to enable such behaviour
using patches available in ``lib/ext/mbedcrypto``. Implementations might disable
the ``tfm_builtin_key_loader`` and then must provide their own alternative storage
location for all of the TF-M required builtin keys, e.g. by having them stored in
a Secure Element with a corresponding opaque driver.

Service API description
-----------------------

The ``Alloc`` and ``Init`` modules implement public APIs which are specific to
the TF-M Crypto service, and are available only internally to other components
of the TF-M Crypto partition. For a detailed description of the prototypes
please refer to the ``tfm_crypto_api.h`` header.

Configuration parameters
------------------------

The TF-M Crypto service exposes some configuration parameters to tailor
the service configuration in terms of supported functionalities and
hence FLASH/RAM size to meet the requirements of different platforms and
use cases. These parameters can be provided via CMake parameters during
the CMake configuration step and as a configuration header to allow the
configuration of the Mbed TLS library. When using Kconfig they are also
exported in the Kconfig menus.
