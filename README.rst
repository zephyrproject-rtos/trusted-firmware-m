##################

Trusted Firmware M provides a reference implementation of secure world software
for ARMv8-M. The TF-M itself is provided under a BSD-3-Clause.

.. Note::
    The software implementation contained in this project is designed to be a
    reference implementation of the Platform Security Architecture (PSA).
    It currently does not implement all the features of that architecture,
    however we expect the code to evolve along with the specifications.
