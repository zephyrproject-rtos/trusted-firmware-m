 * Maximum size of the measured boot record.

 * Its size can be calculated based on the following aspects:
 *     - There are 5 allowed software component claims
 *       (SW type, version, signer ID, measurement description and value),
 *     - SHA256/SHA384 is used as the measurement method meaning that the
 *       measurement value and signer ID are 32/48 bytes long,
 * Considering these aspects and the fact that the string-like claim values
 * vary in length but have a maximum value, the maximum size of a boot record
 * can be calculated.
