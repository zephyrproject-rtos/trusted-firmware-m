This is just things to support running and debug under Microsoft Visual Studio.
So far, it contains a "stand-in" for the unistd.h library, and more specifically,
the isatty() call in that library, which is used by Lex&YACC.  Other functions
may be added later as needed.  At some time in the future, an up-coming "inter-
active mode" for interactively creating test templates may need an actual working
isatty(), but that's not ready yet.
