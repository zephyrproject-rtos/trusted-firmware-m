The numbered files are test-template files -- input to TF-Fuzz -- for demon-
strating what it can do.

The "r" shell script is designed to make it quick and easy to run the demo
tests one by one:  just type "r 5" for example.

The initial, "purpose" line in each numbered file briefly describes what that
file demonstrates.
