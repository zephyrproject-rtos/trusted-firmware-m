These classes define objects that describe everything needed to generate a PSA
call.  In the future, it's probably possible to, instead of writing these calls
out to a .c file, for target systems that can support sufficiently large memory
footprints, to directly execute these PSA calls from the psa_call-subclass
"tracker" objects.
