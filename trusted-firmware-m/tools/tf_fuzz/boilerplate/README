.../tf_fuzz/boilerplate directory contents:

boilerplate.cpp  boilerplate.hpp

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the C++ code to work with the customizable, "boilerplate" code
snippets in the .../lib directory.  Actually, mostly what this code does is
read these code snippets into an STL vector of, essentially, named strings.

This is currently implemented as a vector of strings, with a parallel vector
of const int array-index names.  A much better way, in hindsight, to manage
the boilerplate code is in an STL "map" container.
