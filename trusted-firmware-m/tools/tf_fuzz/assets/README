This directory contains C++ header and program files for classes of objects that
track PSA assets, notably during the Simulate phase.

These hold current state of those assets as the run is simulated, after the
exact sequence of PSA commands to be executed is generated by the Parse stage.

Currently, the Simulate stage, which should be completely distinct from the
initial Parse stage, in hindsight, is a bit muddled up with the Parse stage.
