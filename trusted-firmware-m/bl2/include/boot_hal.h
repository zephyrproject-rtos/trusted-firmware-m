/*
 * \brief It clears that part of the RAM which was used by MCUBoot, expect the
 *        TFM_SHARED_DATA area, which is used to pass data to the TF-M runtime.
 *
 * \note  This function must be implemented per target platform by system
 *        integrator. If the bootloader has not loaded any secret to the shared
 *        RAM then this function can immediately return to shorten the boot-up
 *        time. Clearing RAM area can be done several way, it is platform
 *        dependent:
 *        - Overwritten with a pre-defined constant value (i.e.: 0).
 *        - Overwritten with a random value.
 *        - Change the secret if its location is known.
 *        - Set a register which can hide some part of the flash/RAM against
 *          next stage software components.
 *        - Etc.
