 * reply()              - Reply PSA client call return result to NSPE.
 *                        The parameter owner identifies the owner of the PSA
 *                        client call.
 * handle_req_irq_src() - Handle PSA client call request from NSPE and identify
 *                        mailbox message source according to irq_src.
 * process_new_msg()    - OPTIONAL: Process a message awaiting in the mailbox.
 *                        Returns the number messages that have been processed.
 *                        If the platform does not use support for Hybrid
 *                        Platform, then this handler must be set to NULL.
